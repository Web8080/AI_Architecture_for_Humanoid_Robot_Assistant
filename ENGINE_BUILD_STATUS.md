## PRODUCTION QUALITY STANDARDS

Each production engine must have:

✅ **Documentation (100-150 lines)**
- Comprehensive docstring explaining purpose
- Use cases and scenarios
- Technical approach details
- Safety considerations
- Multi-tier fallback explanation

✅ **Robust Implementation (300-500 lines)**
- Full error handling for all tiers
- Comprehensive input validation
- Detailed logging at each step
- Performance timing
- State tracking

✅ **Helper Methods (100-150 lines)**
- Triage/priority calculation
- Sensor fusion algorithms
- Data validation
- Result formatting

✅ **Comments Throughout**
- Every function documented
- Complex logic explained
- Edge cases noted
- Performance considerations

**Example:** VictimDetectionEngine = 625 lines (meets all standards)

## REVIEW LOCATIONS

**All engines can be found in:**
```
/Users/user/humaniod_robot_assitant/src/engines/

├── search_rescue/          # 10 engines (1 production, 9 placeholder)
├── healthcare/             # 11 engines (all placeholder)
├── industrial/             # 7 engines (all placeholder)
└── interaction/            # 5 existing home engines

Total: 33 engines across all categories
```

**To review any engine:**
```bash
# View any engine
cat src/engines/search_rescue/victim_detection_engine.py

# Count lines in any folder
wc -l src/engines/search_rescue/*.py
```

## ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME

**At current production quality pace:**
- 1 production engine = 625 lines = ~30 minutes
- 29 remaining upgrades = ~14.5 hours
- 10 new home engines (placeholder) = ~2 hours
- 3 new industrial engines (placeholder) = ~1 hour

**Total:** ~17.5 hours to complete all 40 engines to production quality

**Realistic timeline:** 2-3 days working full-time

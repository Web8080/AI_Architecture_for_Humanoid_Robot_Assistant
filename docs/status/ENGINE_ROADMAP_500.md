## ESTIMATED TIMELINE

**At current pace (30 min per production engine):**
- 500 engines × 30 minutes = 15,000 minutes
- 15,000 minutes ÷ 60 = 250 hours
- 250 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 31 working days
- **Timeline: 6-8 weeks full-time development**

**Realistic with reviews and testing:**
- **12-16 weeks** (3-4 months)

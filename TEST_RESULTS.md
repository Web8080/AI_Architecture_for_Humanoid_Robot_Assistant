-  Service detection: Worked without Redis, Ollama, APIs
-  Dependency detection: Fell back when packages unavailable

### **3. Production-Ready Error Handling**

**Observed:**
- Comprehensive logging at each tier attempt
- Clear warnings (not errors) when tiers unavailable

-  Passed all 8 comprehensive tests
-  Demonstrated intelligent tier selection
-  Generated real artifacts (audio files, vector stores, sessions)
-  Maintained functionality through graceful degradation
-  Provided clear visibility through logging

**This is exactly what production-grade, fault-tolerant AI systems should do.**

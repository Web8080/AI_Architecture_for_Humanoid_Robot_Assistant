##  Data Flow

```
Sensors → Perception Service → Multimodal Fusion → Reasoning → Action Planning
                ↓                      ↓                ↓
              Vision Service    NLP Service       Memory Service
                                     ↓
                              Orchestrator (coordinates all services)
```

##  MLOps Pipeline

```
Data Collection → Annotation → Preprocessing → Training → 
Evaluation → Optimization → Registry → Deployment → Monitoring → Feedback Loop
```

##  Deployment Patterns

### Edge Deployment (NVIDIA Jetson)
- Real-time perception and control
- Optimized models (TensorRT)
- Local safety checks

### Cloud Deployment
- Heavy model training
- Large LLM inference
- Data aggregation and retraining

### Hybrid Edge-Cloud
- Critical operations on edge
- Non-critical operations offloaded to cloud
- Graceful degradation when offline

- **C++**: Google C++ Style Guide (for ROS2 nodes)
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings
- **Testing**: pytest, minimum 80% coverage
- **Git**: Conventional Commits

##  Security Layers

- API authentication and authorization
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Model watermarking and provenance
- Privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, federated learning)
- Audit logging

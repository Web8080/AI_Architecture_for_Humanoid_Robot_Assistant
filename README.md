# Humanoid Robot Assistant - AI Brain Architecture

**A State-of-the-Art Embodied AI System for Humanoid Robotics**

> **Note:** This system is designed for benign applications including search & rescue, healthcare assistance, industrial inspection, and research platforms. The architecture prioritizes safety, explainability, and human-centered design.

##  Project Overview

This repository contains the complete AI "brain" for a humanoid robot assistant, integrating cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Multimodal Fusion, and Embodied AI technologies optimized for NVIDIA hardware and cloud deployment.

##  Core Capabilities

- **Advanced NLP**: Multi-turn dialogue, intent recognition, RAG-based reasoning, emotion detection
- **Computer Vision**: Real-time object detection, segmentation, pose estimation, depth perception, SLAM
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Vision-language understanding, cross-modal reasoning
- **Embodied AI**: Spatial reasoning, manipulation planning, human-robot interaction
- **Cloud-Edge Hybrid**: Optimized for NVIDIA Jetson (edge) and A100/H100 (cloud training)

##  Architecture Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Each AI component is independently deployable and scalable
2. **Safety-First**: Multi-layer safety checks, explainability, human-in-the-loop controls
3. **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive MLOps, monitoring, CI/CD, and governance
4. **Research-Backed**: Built on latest academic research and industry best practices

##  Technology Stack

- **Edge Compute**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX, TensorRT, CUDA
- **Training**: NVIDIA A100/H100, PyTorch, DeepSpeed, Horovod
- **NLP**: Transformer models, LangChain, RAG, quantized LLMs
- **Vision**: YOLO, SAM, Detectron2, OpenCV, CLIP
- **Middleware**: ROS2 Humble, DDS, gRPC, FastAPI
- **MLOps**: MLflow, DVC, Kubeflow, Triton Inference Server
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform

## 🔧 The Problem (User's Concern)

> "phase 1 is not working perfectly, i have not been able to even test phase 2, phase 3 is still out of the question"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Dependency Issues**: Phase 1 NLP module has missing dependencies
2. **Integration Gap**: No clear path from NLP intent → Robot action
3. **Testing Challenges**: Can't test individual components in isolation
4. **Missing Engine Layer**: No capability engines to execute intents

**Our Solution: Engine-Based Architecture** ✅
- Each capability = dedicated engine
- Intent Router maps NLP → Engines
- Multi-tier fallback ensures it always works
- Can test each engine independently
- Based on proven Chapo bot pattern
